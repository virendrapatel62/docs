🎉 Nginx Rate Limiting 🎉

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Think of this as opening the blueprints for your server!

Step 2: Define the Rate Limiting Zone 📊
Inside the http block, add a rate limiting zone. This defines how many requests a client can make in a given time period:

```nginx

http { # other configurations...

    # Define rate limit zone
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;

    # other configurations...

}
```

Here, we're setting a limit of 10 requests per second (r/s) per client. The mylimit zone uses 10MB of shared memory, which can hold about 160,000 IP addresses.

Step 3: Apply Rate Limiting to a Location 🚦

Next, apply the rate limit to a specific location. This can be done in the server block:

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/`

```nginx

server {
listen 80;
server_name your_server_domain_or_IP;

    location / {
        limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20;
        # Other configurations...
    }

}
```

The burst=20 allows a client to exceed the rate limit by 20 requests in a short burst.

Step 4: Test the Configuration 🛠️
Before we go live, let’s test our configuration to ensure there are no errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

Think of this as a safety check before hitting the road!

Step 5: Reload Nginx 🔄

If the test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Your server is now equipped with rate limiting!

Congratulations! You've successfully set up rate limiting on your Nginx server. This will help manage traffic and protect your server from being overwhelmed. Keep exploring and happy hosting! 🥳
