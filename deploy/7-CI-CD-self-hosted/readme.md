# üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Setup for Next.js Project

This guide will walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your Next.js project to a self-hosted server.

## 1. üìù Create a Deployment Script

First, we need a script on your server that handles the deployment.

1. Create the script:

On your server, create a file named `deploy.sh`.

Add the following content:

```bash
# Variables
APP_DIR=/var/www/your-nextjs-app
GIT_REPO=git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git # your ssh git url

# Navigate to the app directory
cd $APP_DIR

# Pull the latest changes
# assuming you already cloned the project
git pull $GIT_REPO

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Restart the app using PM2
# Check for the name using `pm2 list`
pm2 restart <APP-NAME>
```

2. Make the script executable:

Run the following command to make sure the script can be executed:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/deploy.sh
```

This command changes the script‚Äôs permissions, allowing it to be executed.

## 2. üîë Set Up SSH Key for GitHub Actions

You need to set up SSH keys to allow GitHub Actions to access your server securely.

Generate an SSH key on your server:

Run this command on your server:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy"
```

When prompted, press Enter to save the key to the default location and leave the passphrase empty.
This generates a new SSH key pair, with the private key stored in ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.

Add the SSH key to your server's authorized keys:

Append the public key to the authorized_keys file:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This command allows the SSH key to authenticate access to your server.

Add the private key to GitHub Secrets:

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
- Click on New repository secret and add a secret named SSH_PRIVATE_KEY.
- Paste the content of the private key from ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.
- This allows GitHub Actions to use the SSH key for deployments.

## 3. üîÑ Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

Now, let‚Äôs set up the workflow that will handle the CI/CD process.

1. Create the workflow file:

In your repository, create a new file at .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Add the following content:

```yaml
name: üöÄ Deploy Next.js App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger on push to the main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build the project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to server via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.6
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }} # Add SERVER_IP as a GitHub secret
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }} # Add SERVER_USER as a GitHub secret
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            ./deploy.sh
```

In my case `deploy.sh` is in root that is why i will use `./deploy.sh` in script , this can be any path

This workflow will automatically deploy your Next.js app whenever you push to the main branch.

2. Configure GitHub Secrets:

- Add the following secrets in your repository settings:
  - `SERVER_IP`: Your server‚Äôs IP address.
  - `SERVER_USER`: The SSH username to access your server.

## 4. ‚úÖ Trigger the CI/CD Pipeline

- Push your code:

  - Push changes to the main branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically.

- Monitor the Workflow:
  - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to check the status of the deployment.
