# Introduction and Basic Setup

### Overview of DRF

- Whats is Django Rest Framework?

  Understand that Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.

- Why use DRF?

  Learn about the benefits, such as robust serialization, authentication, and easy integration with Django models.

- Core Concepts

  Get an overview of the core components like Serializers, Views, ViewSets, Routers, and more.

### Setting Up Django Project with DRF

- Installing Django and DRF

  Set up a virtual environment and install Django and DRF using pip

  ```bash
  pip install django djangorestframework
  ```

- Creating a New Django Project

  Use django-admin startproject to create a new Django project.

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject myproject
  ```

- Adding DRF to Installed Apps

  In settings.py, add 'rest_framework' to the INSTALLED_APPS list.

  ```python
      INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'rest_framework',
      ]
  ```

### Understanding Serializers

- What is a Serializer?

  - Learn how serializers are used to convert complex data types like Django models into JSON and vice versa.

- Creating a Simple Serializer

  - Start by creating a basic serializer for a Django model. For example, if you have a Book model:

    ```python
    from rest_framework import serializers
    from .models import Book
        class BookSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
            title = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
            author = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
            published_date = serializers.DateField()
    ```

- Using ModelSerializer

  - Understand the difference between a basic serializer and a ModelSerializer, which provides a shortcut for serializing Django models.

  - A ModelSerializer in Django REST Framework (DRF) is a shortcut for creating serializers that deal with Django models. It automatically generates fields and validators based on the model you specify.

    ```python
    from django.db import models

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        published_date = models.DateField()
        isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, unique=True)
        price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

    ```

    Serializer (serializers.py)

    ```python
    from rest_framework import serializers
    from .models import Book

    class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Book
            fields = '__all__'
            # Alternatively, you can specify fields explicitly:
            # fields = ['title', 'author', 'published_date', 'isbn', 'price']
    ```

### Creating Basic API Views

- Function based views

  ```python
  from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
  from rest_framework.response import Response

  @api_view(['GET'])
  def book_list(request):
      books = Book.objects.all()
      serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)
      return Response(serializer.data)
  ```

- Class-Based Views (CBVs)

  ```python
  from rest_framework.views import APIView

  class BookList(APIView):
      def get(self, request):
          books = Book.objects.all()
          serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)
          return Response(serializer.data)
  ```

These steps provide a strong foundation, introducing you to the key concepts and basic setup of Django Rest Framework. Youâ€™ll start building simple APIs using function-based and class-based views, giving you practical experience with DRF right from the start.
